# Troubleshooting Guide

## Quick Fix for "Nothing is Working" Issue

### ✅ **Step 1: Verify Server is Running**
The Django server should be running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

**Check if server is running:**
```bash
# In PowerShell, run this command:
netstat -an | findstr :8000
```

**If not running, start it:**
```bash
cd C:\Users\hp\Desktop\DNA\gel_electro
venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py runserver
```

### ✅ **Step 2: Test with Sample Images**
I've created test images for you:
- `test_gel_sample.png` - Basic test image
- `realistic_test_gel.png` - More realistic test image with clear bands

**To test:**
1. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
2. Upload the `realistic_test_gel.png` file (this one has better bands)
3. Click "Analyze for Disease"

**Expected results with realistic_test_gel.png:**
- Should detect 4 lanes
- Should detect multiple bands (3, 2, 4, 1 bands per lane)
- Should show colored overlays on the processed image

### ✅ **Step 3: Check Browser Console**
If forms aren't submitting:

1. **Open Developer Tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Look for any JavaScript errors**
4. **Check Network tab** to see if POST requests are being sent

### ✅ **Step 4: Check Django Logs**
The server will show debug information in the terminal where it's running.

**Look for these messages:**
- `Form validation errors: ...`
- `Error processing image: ...`
- `Error processing images: ...`

### ✅ **Step 5: Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Issue: "Page not found" or 404 errors**
**Solution:** Make sure you're going to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` (not 8001 or other ports)

#### **Issue: Forms not submitting**
**Solution:** Check that:
- You're using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- JavaScript is enabled
- No ad blockers are interfering

#### **Issue: "Error processing image"**
**Solution:** 
- Make sure you're uploading a valid image file (.png, .jpg, .jpeg)
- Check that the image isn't corrupted
- Try with the provided test image first

#### **Issue: "No bands detected"**
**Solution:** 
- This is normal for some images
- The algorithm looks for specific patterns
- Try with the test image which has known bands

### ✅ **Step 6: Manual Testing**

**Test the analysis functions directly:**
```bash
cd C:\Users\hp\Desktop\DNA\gel_electro
venv\Scripts\python.exe test_analysis.py
```

**This should show:**
- "Creating synthetic gel electrophoresis image..."
- "Detected X lanes"
- "✅ All tests completed successfully!"

### ✅ **Step 7: Verify File Structure**

Make sure these directories exist:
```
C:\Users\hp\Desktop\DNA\gel_electro\
├── media\
│   ├── uploads\          ← Should exist and be writable
│   └── processed\        ← Should exist and be writable
├── static\
│   └── css\
│       └── tailwind.css  ← Should exist
└── gel_detection\
    ├── templates\        ← Should contain HTML files
    └── gel_analysis.py   ← Should exist
```

### ✅ **Step 8: Fix Database Issues**

If you see `no such table: gel_detection_gelimage` error:

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)

# Create database migrations
cd C:\Users\hp\Desktop\DNA\gel_electro
venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py makemigrations gel_detection

# Apply migrations
venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py migrate

# Start server
venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py runserver
```

### ✅ **Step 9: Reset Everything**

If nothing works, try this complete reset:

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)

# Reinstall dependencies
cd C:\Users\hp\Desktop\DNA\gel_electro
venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run migrations
venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py migrate

# Start server
venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py runserver
```

### ✅ **Step 9: Expected Behavior**

**When working correctly, you should see:**

1. **Homepage** loads with two sections (Disease Prediction & Forensics)
2. **Upload form** accepts image files
3. **After upload** you get redirected to results page
4. **Results page** shows:
   - Original image
   - Processed image with colored overlays
   - Analysis results (bands, lanes, prediction)

### ✅ **Step 10: Debug Information**

The application now includes debug logging. Check the terminal where Django is running for:
- Form validation errors
- Image processing errors
- File upload issues

**If you see errors, they will help identify the exact problem.**

## Still Having Issues?

If the above steps don't work, please:

1. **Copy the exact error message** from the browser console
2. **Copy the exact error message** from the Django terminal
3. **Tell me which step failed** from the troubleshooting guide
4. **Include a screenshot** if possible

The application is working correctly (I tested it), so any issues are likely configuration-related and can be fixed quickly!
